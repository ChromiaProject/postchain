/**
 * Keeps notes on a single peer.
 * Fast Sync has to deal with drained nodes. Some rules:
 *
 * When a peer has been marked DRAINED for a certain
 * amount of time [params.resurrectUnresponsiveTime] resp.) it will be given
 * a new chance to serve us blocks. Otherwise we might run out of
 * peers to sync from over time.
 *
 * The DRAINED state is reset to SYNCABLE whenever we receive a valid header for a
 * height higher than the height at which it was drained or when we
 * receive a Status message (which is sent regularly from peers in normal
 * sync mode).
