/**
 * This class syncs blocks from its peers by requesting <parallelism> blocks
 * from random peers simultaneously.
 *
 * The peers respond to the requests using a BlockHeader immediately followed
 * by an UnfinishedBlock, but if they don't have the block, they respond with
 * their latest BlockHeader and the height that was requested. If they
 * don't have any blocks at all, they reply with a BlockHeader with empty header
 * and witness.
 *
 * Requests that times out: When a request to a peer has been outstanding for a
 * long time (fastSyncParams.jobTimeout), we must timeout and stop using that
 * peer, at least temporarily. Otherwise it will hold up the syncing process
 * every now and then when that peer has been (randomly) selected.
 *
 * We only use random known peers (from the peerCommConfiguration) to sync from.
 *
 * If there are no live peers, it will wait [params.exitDelay] until it leaves fastsync and starts
 * trying to build blocks on its own. This is not a problem in a real world scenario, since you can wait a minute
 * or so upon first start. But in tests, this can be really annoying. So tests that only runs a single node
 * should set [params.exitDelay] to 0.
