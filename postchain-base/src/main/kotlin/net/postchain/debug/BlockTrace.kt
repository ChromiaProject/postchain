/**
 * READ THIS BEFORE DELETING THIS CLASS!
 *
 * Some synchronization errors won't show up in the debugger because they happen too seldom, so the logfile is the
 * only way to track them down.
 *
 * This is a collection of various info we know about the block, valuable for test where we
 * run multiple nodes and it's not clear from the logs WHY a thread is doing what it is doing.
 *
 * Example to be more specific:
 * For historic sync the block construction passes through 3 threads, typically:
 *
 *  1. [historicSync-X] (where we attempt to add a block) ->
 *  2. [-1-BaseBlockDatabaseWorker] (running BlockDatabase.addBlock()) Note1: Normal logging doesn't print in here, not sure why? ->
 *  3. [-1-BaseBlockDatabaseWorker] (running BlockBuilder.commit()) Note2: But in here the regular logging works again. ->
 *  4. [pool-4-thread-1] (running ProcMan, handling potential restart)
 *
 * When we are at step 4 it's usually pretty difficult to see what block caused the restart.
 * This object works as an "external ID" (often used to track flow between different apps).
 *
 * Thing about performance
 * -----------------------
 * To avoid performance hit on a production system, this object should never be created, and thus always be "null"
 * unless "DEBUG" or lower level of logging has been turned on.
 *
 * Incomplete data
 * ---------------
 * Often we don't have all info at once, so it has to be collected over time.
 * Example: Initially, in [PostchainNode] we might only know the chainId and node's PubKey.
 *          Later, in the [BaseBlockManager] we know the block we are building, so we add that info.
