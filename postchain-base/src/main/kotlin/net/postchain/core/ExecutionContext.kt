/**
 * Concept of a "context" is an object that knows a bit about the current state of things.
 * A "context" might know more or less things. This list starts from "stupid" and goes to "smart":
 * 1. [AppContext] - we don't know much only how to get to the DB (this is the most vague context),
 *                   Most common reason to use this context is b/c we are not be working with a specific chain
 *                   at the moment.
 * 2. [ExecutionContext] - we know what blockchain we are working on (there is a similar interface called
 *                         [BlockchainContext] that also know the BC RID),
 * 3. [BlockEContext] - we also know what block we are working on,
 * 4. [TxEContext] - we also know what TX we are working on (this is the most knowledgeable context).
