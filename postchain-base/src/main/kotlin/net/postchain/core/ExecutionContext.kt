/**
 * TODO: this seems out of place here, also obsolete:
1. Manager reads JSON and finds BlockchainConfigurationFactory class name.
2. Manager instantiates a class which implements BlockchainConfigurationFactory interface, and feeds it JSON data.
3. BlockchainConfigurationFactory creates BlockchainConfiguration object.
4. BlockchainConfiguration acts as a block factory and creates a transaction factory, presumably passing it configuration data in some form.
5. TransactionFactory will create Transaction objects according to configuration, possibly also passing it the configuration data.
6. Transaction object can perform its duties according to the configuration it received, perhaps creating sub-objects called transactors and passing them the configuration.
