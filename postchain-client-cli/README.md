# Postchain-clien-cli

This module is a CLI for sending transactions to a postchain node

## Command line P.C. client

Currently we only describe how to start manage a Postchain server via command line, since it's rather unusual to issue 
TXs from the command line. See [the guide](https://gitlab.com/chromaway/postchain/-/wikis/QuickGuide) for more info.
