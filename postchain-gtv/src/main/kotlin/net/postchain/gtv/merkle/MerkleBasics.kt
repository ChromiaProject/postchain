/**
 * This file holds some basic stuff, like constants etc.
 *
 * Some generic documentation (package wide documentation) goes here too, see below:
 *
 * ---------
 * Design Overview
 * ---------
 * The way to create a merkle proof tree and to actually prove it using the code in this package is done this way:
 *
 * 1. Transform the hierarchy (usually a [Gtv]) to a binary tree (usually a [GtvBinaryTree]).
 *       - The reason we have this unnecessary step, is to be able to look at the binary tree in tests before it's
 *       destroyed (Easier to find bugs if we move in small steps).
 * 2. Transform the binary tree into a proof tree (usually a [GtvMerkleProofTree]).
 *       - To do this we have to provide a path (usually [GTXPath]) to the element(s) we want to prove.
 *       - The proof tree will hold the element(s) (=values-to-be-proven) in clear text, but the rest of the tree is
 *     only hashes.
 *       - The proof tree is the "proof" that the element(s) belongs in the hierarchy.
 * 3. Calculate the merkle root of the proof tree.
 *       - If the merkle root is the same as the merkle root described in the block, we know the proof is valid.
 * ---------
 *
 * ---------
 * Prefixes added before we hash
 * ---------
 * Motivation for the use of prefixes can be found at various places, for example:
 *
 * https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2018/06/09/leaf-node-weakness-in-bitcoin-merkle-tree-design/
 *
 * (Excerpt from blog post)
 * The Problem
 *
 * Bitcoin Merkle tree makes no distinction between inner nodes and leaf nodes. The depth of the
 * tree is implicitly given by the number of transactions. Inner nodes have no specific format,
 * and are 64 bytes in length. Therefore, an attacker can submit to the blockchain a transaction that has
 * exactly 64 bytes in length and then force a victim system to re-interpret this transaction as an inner node
 * of the tree.
 *  An attacker can therefore provide an SPV proof (a Merkle branch) that adds an additional leaf node extending
 *  the dual transaction/node and provide proof of payment of any transaction he wishes.
 *
 * Remedy
 * (The fifth solution suggestion is the one we are using:)
 * 5. A hard-forking solution is adding a prefix to internal nodes of the Merkle tree before performing node
 * hashing and adding a different prefix to transaction IDs and then also hash them.
 * Ripple ([2]) uses a such a prefix system.
