        Vulnerability in Guava if using com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir. No version exists
        without this vulnerability, but the function is marked as deprecated in version 30+
        We do not use this function in the code so handled as false positive.

        Disputed. The vendor's perspective is that this is not a valid vulnerability report, because the
        steps of constructing a cyclic data structure and trying to serialize it cannot be achieved by
        an external attacker.
